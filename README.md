## Overview
This project investigates how real-world events are reflected in social media signals.

The project achieved a distinction (80%) under the auspices of [Prof. Martin Bekker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinbekker/) and was moderated by ECSA.

The code for each event type follows a similar pattern and is available in the repository and hosted on Kaggle. 

Extensive work was done to create an analysis pipeline for each event archetype using Big Data processing techniques, SQL, cloud computing and data science techniques displayed on Kaggle.

The report can be seen in the repo, and the poster, coupled with the slideshow, which was effectively presented and communicated to both technical and non-technical audiences.
