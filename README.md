The project achieved a distinction (80%) under the auspices of [Prof. Martin Bekker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinbekker/) and was moderated by ECSA.

The report can be seen in the repo, and the poster, coupled with the slideshow, was effectively presented and communicated to both technical and non-technical audiences.
