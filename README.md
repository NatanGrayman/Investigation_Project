# Twitter Event Signatures


## Overview
This project investigates how real-world events are reflected in social media signals, particularly on Twitter. By analyzing datasets from Kaggle, the Internet Archive, and GDELT, the study focuses on protests, natural disasters, and election cycles. Techniques such as seasonal decomposition and LOESS regression were employed to identify trends and create distinct event archetypes.

The project achieved a distinction (80%) under the auspices of [Prof. Martin Bekker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinbekker/) and was moderated by ECSA.


## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Utilizing over 1Tb of open-source data from Kaggle, the Internet Archive, GDELT and Google Trends.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming data for analysis.
3. **Geolocation Analysis**: Mapping tweet activities to geographical locations.
4. **Mathematical Trend Analysis**: Employing seasonal decomposition and LOESS regression to identify trends.
5.  **Trend Validation**: Comparing Twitter trends with news media responses and Google Trends data.


## Key Findings
- **Event Types Analyzed**: Protests, Natural Disasters, Election Cycles
- **Data Sources**: Kaggle, Internet Archive, GDELT, Google Trends
- **Methods Used**: Seasonal decomposition, LOESS regression
- **Results**: Creation of event archetypes for each event type, offering valuable insights into the relationship between event types and Twitter trends.
